Notes:

##### game_improved.py is the new and improved version of the game outcome predictor
###### game_improved.py allows user to pit teams from different years against each other
###### I made a new repo 'pure-game-metric' that expands on the metric I use in game_improved.py

###### playground.py was an exploratory script that determined which stats displayed the best correlation to wins
